The study explores the application of forecasting techniques in predicting sales, specifically focusing on the retail giant Walmart. Sales forecasting plays a crucial role in aiding businesses like Walmart in making informed decisions. By leveraging time-series data, the work involves identifying trends, conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), and visualizing correlations to enhance the understanding of underlying patterns.

The primary objective is to develop a Time Series Forecasting model for weekly sales at Walmart, aiming to improve prediction accuracy. The SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model is employed to enhance performance in forecasting future sales. The study encompasses the evaluation of various forecasting models and tests, including SARIMA and the Adfuller test.

Additionally, the analysis delves into the trend and seasonal components within the sales data. ACF (AutoCorrelation Function) and PACF (Partial AutoCorrelation Function) plots are utilized to identify the optimal SARIMA model for forecasting sales in the near future. Through a comprehensive examination of forecasting models, the study concludes that the SARIMA model provides the best fit for predicting future sales at Walmart.
